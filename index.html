<p> I disagree with what china is doing because i dont like when people copy stuff from others and make money out of it</p>
<p>When a movie is created in america and then china takes the idea of the movie and makes a movie very similar to the movie</p>
<p>The people made a movie similar to one in america then thats consired violating copyright because you took someones idea and he is making money out of he didnt came up with</p>
<p> but in china people dont care about copyright, the just copy each other</p>
<p> thats why i think what china is doing is wring and i also think United States should never be like China because a lot of people will not be making money out of their work</p>
